# AIO Recolor Pack

This mod includes all the animation recolors by me, as well as includes the unreleased Wisdom Form recolors and all new Master Form, Final Form, Anti Form, and Magic recolors, all consolidated into one mod!

There's a tool installed in the mod called "AIO Recolor Tool", this will allow you to change the animation colors of the desired form or magic!

Notes:
- When changing the color of Magic, some effects like Blizzard aren't affected until Blizzara.
- When changing the color of Magic, some effects like Fire and Thunder affect other, non-instances of said magic as the effects used for them are used universally. Like on Ultima Weapon's clashes, Axel's Fire Floor, Larxene's lightning attacks, etc.
- When choosing the "Random Choice" option, the tool will randomly select any of the currently available colors.
